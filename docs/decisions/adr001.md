# ADR001: Initial Architecture Decisions

## Context
Building starve.io-like game; LLM-developed; no backward compat.

## Decisions
- Server-authoritative: Trust no client.
- Single integrated: Rust + DB only runtime.
- Fixed tick: Deterministic simulation.
- Binary protocol: Efficient, versioned.
- Postgres only: No extras.
- TS build-time: No Node runtime.

## Consequences
- Bold refactors allowed; focus correctness.
- Deep source tree; frequent commits.
