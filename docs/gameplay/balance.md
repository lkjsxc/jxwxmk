# Balancing Guidelines

## Resources
- Respawn times: Wood (fast), rare ores (slow).
- Density: Higher in biomes; depletion in crowded areas.

## Combat
- Damage scaling: Tier-based (e.g., reidite > wood).
- Health bars: Players 100; mobs 50-200.

## Survival
- Drain rates: Hunger/thirst every 10 ticks.
- Buffs: Food gives +health; garlic resists cold.

## Testing
- Simulate N players; adjust for fun/difficulty.
