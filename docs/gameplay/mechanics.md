- Tools required for higher tiers (e.g., stone pick for gold).
- Respawn: Depleted nodes regenerate over time; server tracks.

## Crafting
- Recipes: Materials + station (e.g., workbench).
- Queued with timers; yields progression points.
- Tiers: Basic (wood) to advanced (reidite).

## Survival
- Bars: Hunger, thirst, health.
- Drain over time; replenish via consumables.
- Environmental: Temperature/biome effects (e.g., cold damage).

## Combat
- Melee/ranged weapons; armor reduces damage.
- PvP/PvM: Mobs with AI (aggro, pathing).
- Server resolves hits.
