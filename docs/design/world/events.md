# World Events

Large-scale events provide MMORPG pacing and shared goals.

## Event Types

- **Caravans**: merchant routes between settlements; escort or raid.
- **Invasions**: biome-specific mobs attack a settlement.
- **World Bosses**: rare spawns with server-wide announcements.
- **Resource Surges**: short windows with boosted node respawns.
- **Seasonal Festivals**: limited-time quests, cosmetics, and bonuses.
- **Storm Fronts**: moving weather hazards that affect multiple chunks.

## Participation Rules

- Event participation scales rewards by contribution.
- Events spawn in active regions to avoid empty-world triggers.
- Difficulty scales with nearby player count and average level.
