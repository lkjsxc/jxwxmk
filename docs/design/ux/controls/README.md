# Controls

The game uses a single shared interaction model across devices. Only the input device mapping differs; gameplay rules never diverge between PC and mobile.

## Interaction Rules

- Tap/click = primary action (attack/gather).
- Long-press/hold = interact (open/use/talk).
- No on-screen A/B buttons.
- Keyboard shortcuts are additive; they do not change gameplay outcomes.

## Input Schemes

- [Mobile (Touch)](mobile.md)
- [Desktop (Mouse/Keyboard)](desktop.md)
