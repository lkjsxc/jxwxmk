# Controls

The game uses a single shared interaction model across devices. The documents below only describe how each input device maps to the same actions (tap/click = attack, long-press/hold = interact). Desktop keeps keyboard shortcuts, but gameplay rules are identical on PC and mobile.

## Input Schemes

- [Mobile (Touch)](mobile.md)
- [Desktop (Mouse/Keyboard)](desktop.md)
