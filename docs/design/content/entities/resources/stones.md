# Stones

Stone nodes are leveled by density and tool requirements.

- **Granite (L1)**: meadow/forest, basic stone blocks.
- **Limestone (L1)**: coast, mortar material.
- **Sandstone (L2)**: desert, brittle blocks.
- **Slate (L2)**: mountain, roofing stone.
- **Basalt (L3)**: volcanic, heat-resistant blocks.
- **Marble (L4)**: mountain, decorative stone.
- **Obsidian (L6)**: volcanic, sharp shards.
- **Crystalized Stone (L7)**: alpine, gem dust.
- **Mythic Stone (L9)**: deep biomes, rare cores.

## Notes

- Stone nodes drop both base stone and biome-specific byproducts.
- Higher level stones increase durability of crafted structures.
