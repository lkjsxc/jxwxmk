# Core Loop

The game follows a persistent MMORPG survival loop with long-term progression and social play. The client is a renderer; the server is authoritative.

## Cycle

1. **Identity + Session**: Claim a player ID, obtain a session token, and bind to a settlement spawn.
2. **Spawn + Orient**: Learn local rules, safe-zone boundaries, and nearby stations.
3. **Gather + Survive**: Harvest leveled resources while managing hunger/temperature.
4. **Craft + Build**: Upgrade tools, weapons, armor, and structures; contribute to settlement growth.
5. **Quest + Explore**: Complete quests and achievements to earn XP and unlock new biomes/services.
6. **Compete + Cooperate**: Group up for events, bosses, trade routes, and PvP objectives.
7. **Repeat + Persist**: Carry progression forward via durable items, reputation, and levels.

## Progression Bands

- **Early Game**: Starter settlement, basic tools, local quests, first achievements.
- **Mid Game**: Multi-biome travel, advanced crafting, faction reputation, village upgrades.
- **Late Game**: World events, elite bosses, settlement leadership, rare materials.
