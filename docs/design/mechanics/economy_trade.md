- **Trade vouchers** earned through quests and events.
- **Commodity barter** remains valid for low-tier trading.

## Villager Trading

- Vendors expose buy/sell lists based on biome and settlement tier.
- Prices fluctuate with local supply, demand, and event modifiers.
- Trading reputation unlocks better prices and exclusive goods.

## Player Trading

- Direct player-to-player trade is allowed in safe zones.
- Optional caravan routes enable long-distance commerce bonuses.

## Market Controls

- Settlement taxes apply to sales.
- Anti-inflation sinks: repair fees, crafting taxes, travel tolls.

## Crafting Economy

- High-tier stations require settlement access.
- Rare materials are biome-locked or event-locked.
