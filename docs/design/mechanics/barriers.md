# Barriers + Safe Zones

Barriers define protected zones and anchor settlements.

## Barrier Core

- A barrier core creates a safe-zone radius.
- Core level determines range and settlement tier cap.

## Safe-Zone Rules

- No PvP within the barrier radius.
- Hostile mobs are pushed out or despawned.
- Guard NPCs enforce rules and escort offenders out.

## Settlement Integration

- Each settlement is centered on a core.
- Respawn and trade services depend on core integrity.
- Damaged cores reduce safe-zone size until repaired.

## Configuration

- Core parameters live in `config/settlements.json`.
