# Barriers

Barriers are protective zones that eliminate hostile mobs within their range. They are anchored by a **Barrier Core**.

## Mechanics
- **Hostile Elimination**: Any hostile mob (e.g., Wolf, Bear) that enters the barrier's range is eliminated.
- **Village Safe Zones**: NPCs and villages are always located within barriers.
- **Range**: The range of the barrier depends on its level.
- **Levels**: Barriers can have different levels. Higher levels provide a wider range of protection.

## Placement Rules
- **World Center**: A barrier core is always placed at the world center.
- **Probabilistic Placement**: Additional barriers may be spawned throughout the world. The probability of placement increases as the distance to the world center decreases.

## Configuration
Barrier properties like base range and level scaling are configurable in `config.json`.
