# Survival Mechanics

Survival is the primary pressure on the player.

## Spawning
- **Random Location**: Players spawn at a random coordinate `(x, y)` within the world bounds (0,0 to Width,Height) to prevent camping and spread population.

## Vitals
- **Health (HP)**: 0-100.
- **Hunger**: 0-100.
- **Temperature**: 0-100.
