# Crafting System

Crafting is tiered and tied to settlement infrastructure.

## Contents

- [Recipes](recipes.md)
- [Stations](stations.md)
- [Crafting UI](ui.md)

## Principles

- Server-authoritative recipes and validation.
- Higher tiers require advanced stations and biome materials.

## Stations

- **Hand**: starter items only.
- **Workbench**: tools, basic structures.
- **Forge**: metal weapons and armor.
- **Tannery**: leather gear.
- **Alchemy**: potions and reagents.
- **Carpentry**: advanced structures and furniture.

## Recipe Tiers

- Tier 1-3: local settlement, common resources.
- Tier 4-6: biome-specific materials and travel.
- Tier 7-10: world events, rare drops, and faction access.

## Crafting UI

- Recipes are filtered by available station and player tier.
- Missing components are highlighted with source hints.
