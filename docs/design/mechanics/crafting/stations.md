# Stations

Stations are not yet used to gate recipes in the current implementation.

## Structures Present

- **Workbench**: Placeable structure with configured health; does not unlock recipes yet.
- **Torch**: Placeable light source; no gameplay effects beyond visuals.

## Future Ideas (Not Implemented)

- Workbench to unlock advanced recipes.
- Furnace for cooking and smelting.
