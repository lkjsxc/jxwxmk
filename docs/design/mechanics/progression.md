# Progression + Tiers

Progression is multi-track: player levels, skill mastery, and tech tiers.

## Player Levels

- XP from combat, gathering, crafting, quests, and events.
- Level gates unlock new recipes, biomes, and settlement services.

## Skill Lines

- **Gathering**: axes, picks, sickles; reduces stamina cost and increases yield.
- **Crafting**: faster crafting, access to higher-tier stations.
- **Combat**: weapon mastery and ability unlocks.
- **Survival**: resistances against heat, cold, poison.

## Tech Tiers (1-10)

- Every major system has a tier: tools, weapons, armor, stations, resources.
- Tier upgrades require rare materials and settlement stations.

## Resource Levels

- All nodes and creatures have levels (L1-L10).
- Level influences:
  - Required tool tier.
  - Yield quantity/quality.
  - Respawn cooldown.

## Item Levels

- Items carry a level and quality band.
- Crafted items inherit level from their primary material tier.
