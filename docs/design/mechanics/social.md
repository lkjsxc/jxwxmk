# Social Systems

MMORPG-scale play requires durable social tools and shared goals.

## Implementation status

These systems require explicit protocol messages, persistence, and UI.
They are **planned** for now unless/ until promoted into scope (see: `docs/implementation/reconstruction_scope.md`).

## Parties

- Up to 6 players per party.
- Shared XP and quest credit within range.
- Party leader can set rally markers.

## Guilds / Clans

- Persistent groups with ranks and permissions.
- Shared storage and settlement influence.
- Guild missions unlock cosmetic and economic perks.

## Communication

- Proximity chat, party chat, guild chat.
- Bulletin boards in settlements for recruitment and trade.

## Cooperative Features

- Group quests and dungeon gates.
- Shared crafting projects (multi-step build chains).
- World event leaderboards by group.
