# Agents and responsibilities

This project is developed by LLM agents. Responsibilities:

- Project scaffolding and documentation: setup agent
- Server (Rust) implementation: backend agent
- Client (TypeScript) implementation: frontend agent
- Devops (Docker Compose): orchestration agent

Agents communicate via repository commits and this AGENTS.md serves as the registry.
